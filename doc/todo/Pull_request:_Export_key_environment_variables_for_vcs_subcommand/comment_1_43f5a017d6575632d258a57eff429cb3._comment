Looking back at [[!commit 65eda73020e0aa6bf15e64106dae955bf17a41dd]], the
initial idea of `etckeeper vcs` was to run the command in the same
environment that etckeeper uses. Which it does do for `HOME` and a few
other things.

So I'm broadly in agreement that this might be a good idea. But copying
86 lines of quite hairy code is certainly not a maintainable way to do it.

There's also the question of whether a user might be surprised to find
specific things that happen to be set in the `etckeeper commit` environment
being set.

Also worth bearing in mind that `etckeeper commit` needs to run
successfully even if the host doesn't have a hostname configured or in the
face of other problems that typically prevent git from committing. Because
it's run by eg apt hooks, and generally is an abstraction layer where the
user may not be comfortable setting up git. That does not really apply to
`etckeeper vcs`, and so a certian amount of the code from `etckeeper
commit` doesn't seem necessary in `etckeeper vcs`.

(Also you have this line that was accidentially left in:
	echo "Testing; \$USER: $USER"`
)
