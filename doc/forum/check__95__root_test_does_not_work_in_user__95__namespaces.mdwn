when building etckeeper in void linux, which uses user_namespaces(7) to chroot, the tests 8 (and sometimes 7) fail.
see https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/pull/42192
and https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages#chroot-methods

this is (likely) due to the check_root test not detecting that the build is performed inside a chroot.

any suggestion how one could improve that?
