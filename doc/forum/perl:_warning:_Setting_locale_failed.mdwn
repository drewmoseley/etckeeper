Hi,

I'm using macOS (and the iTerm2 terminal emulator) to ssh to a raspberry pi that has Ubuntu 24.04, running the zsh shell.

Whenever I run etckeeper commit (or when it happens implicitly via sudo apt install ...)

I get the following warnings multiple times.

```
$ sudo etckeeper commit
perl: warning: Setting locale failed.
perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:
	LANGUAGE = "en_US.UTF-8",
	LC_ALL = (unset),
	LC_CTYPE = "UTF-8",
	LC_COLLATE = "C",
	LC_TERMINAL = "iTerm2",
	LANG = "en_US.UTF-8"
    are supported and installed on your system.
perl: warning: Falling back to a fallback locale ("en_US.UTF-8").
perl: warning: Setting locale failed.
perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:

	LC_ALL = (unset),
	LC_CTYPE = "UTF-8",

	LC_TERMINAL = "iTerm2",
	LANG = "en_US.UTF-8"
    are supported and installed on your system.

```

My .zshrc exports
```
export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
export LANGUAGE=en_US.UTF-8
```

My env contains 
```
LC_TERMINAL=iTerm2
LC_CTYPE=UTF-8
LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
LANG=en_US.UTF-8
LANGUAGE=en_US.UTF-8
```

I noticed that /etc/etckeeper/pre-commit.d/30store-metadata contains the following lines of code.

```
LC_COLLATE=C
export LC_COLLATE
unset LC_ALL
```

If I comment the code out, the warnings disappears. I assume the statements are needed for a reason though.

I'm not really familiar with locale interactions, so i'm not sure if my config is wrong or it's something that etckeeper doesn't expect.

Would anyone be able to share some advice how I could stop the warnings from happening? Thanks.
